    <p><h4>
        Welcome to the annual North East Event! For 2024, we will be hosting a 
        Camarilla Conclave! 
    </p><p>
        This will be a gathering steeped in the intrigue and tradition of the 
        Vampire: The Masquerade setting. As you join us, you step into an 
        immersive experience full of ancient politics and the friction of a 
        supernatural society. Conclaves offer players the chance to 
        engage with their fellows, debate Camarilla doctrines, and maneuver 
        through the complex social hierarchies of the Kindred; all to guide the 
        future of the Camarilla genre within OWbN. Whether you're a seasoned 
        veteran of our Organization or new to the world of vampires, for this 
        weekend you will help write the next chapter in your characterâ€™s story
        as well as furthering our ever-evolving plot. Come, let the masquerade 
        begin and discover where your allegiances truly lie.
